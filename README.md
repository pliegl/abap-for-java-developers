# Introduction

While new technologies around SAP Cloud Platform such as Java, JavaScript, UI5, etc. are on the rise, ABAP is still the major backbone of SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA core systems. Compared to program languages such as Java, ABAP still has a low visibility outside the SAP world - in particular among non-SAP developers. 

Nowadays, developers are often taught Python or Java at universities and in online tutorials. While Java concepts such as inheritance, object orientation, interfaces, etc. are well known to these folks, little know-how exists about ABAP. 

# Goal

Instead of providing yet another ABAP book or documentation, this repository aims to introduce the basic ABAP concepts such as data types, function modules, classes, etc. using Java/ABAP examples. For each ABAP concept the corresponding implementation in Java and ABAP will be provided. Using such a *by example* approach, Java developers will quickly get acquainted with the relevant concepts of ABAP using easy to understand Java samples. 


## Outline

Currently, we plan for the following structure:

* Data types
* Flow control (If, case, do while)
* Basic math functions and arithmetic operations
* Data Dictionaries, Domains, Tables
* Program modularisation
  * Function modules
  * Form subroutines
  * Classes
